We have just released our first July release candidate, [playtest-20140709](/download/).

This short development cycle has been extremely productive, and includes some long-awaited features:

- The RA and TD game music can now be downloaded and installed from the in-game music player.
- Capturing enemy structures in RA and TD will now let you build units from their faction.
- The maximum tech level can be configured in the lobby options (TD only in this playtest).
- Added an option to lock the mouse cursor inside the game window.

Other big changes include:

- Fixed a number of crashes that were introduced in the last release.
- Improved performance and memory usage.
- Added beacon images for the RA spy plane, paratroopers, and parabombs.
- Multiple players can now repair a building at an accelerated rate.
- Added engine support for diamond-shaped ("isometric") terrain (an important milestone for our TS mod).

As usual, the full list of changes compared with the [June release](/news/release-20140608/) is available [on our wiki](http://wiki.openra.net/Changelog).
